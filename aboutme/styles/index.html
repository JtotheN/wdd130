  <h2>Jen</h2> 
  <p>Hi everyone! My name is Jen. I am working on a professional studies degree, currently working on the information technology portion. I currently work for a small software company as the Director of Client Success Services. I am married, have 1 son, 2 daughters, and 1 bonus son. My youngest daughter who is 10, has down syndrome and keeps us on our toes. I was also recently called into the Relief Society so I am keeping busy. In my spare time, if I had any, I would probably draw or paint. </p>
